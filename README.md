# Virtual TA
A package for managing student grades

## Getting Started

1. Download this repo.
2. Follow the examples in [examples/example_client.py](examples/example_client.py).
3. Look through the example workflows in [tests/functional_tests.py](tests/functional_tests.py).

## Prerequisites

This package requires Python 3.6 or greater, along with the Python modules specified in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).

#### Blackboard Setup

The Blackboard features of this package require a Blackboard API Rest integration registered at the Blackboard API Dev Portal ([https://developer.blackboard.com/](https://developer.blackboard.com/)), with corresponding Application ID, Key, and Secret. The integration should also be registered with a Blackboard Learn instance (e.g., the development virtual machine available from [https://blackboard.secure.force.com/](https://blackboard.secure.force.com/)) and associated with a user account having sufficient access privileges to edit a course's gradebook.

Additional documentation for the Blackboard Learn REST API can be found at [https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/displayApi](https://developer.blackboard.com/portal/displayApi).

#### GitHub Setup

The GitHub features of this package require administrative access to a GitHub Organization, which can be setup for free at [https://www.github.com/](https://www.github.com/), and a corresponding GitHub personal access token generated according to the instructions at [https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens) with scopes `admin:org` and `public_repo`.

Additional documentation for the GitHub REST API can be found at [https://developer.github.com/v3/](https://developer.github.com/v3/).

#### Slack Setup

The Slack features of this package require non-guest access to a Slack Workspace, which can be setup for free at [https://www.slack.com/](https://www.slack.com/), and a corresponding Slack API token generated by visiting
- [https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens) and generating a Legacy Token, or
- [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and creating a new app with permission scopes of `channels:read`, `channels:write`, `chat:write:user`, `groups:read`, `groups:write`, `im:history`, `im:read`, and `users:read`.

Additional documentation for the Slack Web API can be found at [https://api.slack.com/web](https://api.slack.com/web).
